For this project, an executable file containing a Unity game was given: the game features a platform with multiple paths leading to a door and a moveable character. An algorithm in Python was implemented to teach the character how to reach the door by following the optimal path, using the Q-learning approach, a machine learning technique that enables learning through a system of rewards and penalties.
